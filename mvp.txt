MVP:
- Add table view for showing all created forms (formId, formName, postUrl, and fieldIds)
- Add submit button functionality to form renderer to post to given url
- Add space between form fields in form renderer
- Add functionality to form renderer submit button to save submissions in database
    - In addition to posting to given url? Or only if given url is blank?
- Add support for dropdown and radio button
    - Requirements:
        - Each dropdown/radio button needs to have two to many options
        - User needs to be able to add and remove options
    - Implementation:
        - Conditionally add "Add option" button if dropdown or radio button
        - Can't simply add new fields to current fieldForm because each field needs a unique key --> need an array of forms
        - Should probably be an array of forms, for submission parsing
            - Each field form would have an associated array of option field forms
